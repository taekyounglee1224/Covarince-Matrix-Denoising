## Covarince-Matrix-Denoising

### 1. Introduction

Covariance matrix estimation is a cornerstone of financial modeling, underpinning critical tasks such as portfolio optimization, risk management, and asset allocation. In practice, sample covariance matrices (ùö∫") are often noisy due to the limited number of observations, particularly when market dynamics evolve rapidly or datasets span diverse asset classes. This noise undermines the reliability of covariance matrices, leading to suboptimal decisions in financial applications.
